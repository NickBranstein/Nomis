# Nomis
A new take on an endless classic...plus mechs!  Nomis is a HTML5 game created for the 2015 js1k3games competition.

>Near the end of the cold war, the Russians commissioned an engineer, code-named Simon, to make a brain-washing device in the form of a toy.
>The engineer was successful and deployed his device to millions of children the world over. 
>We've recently uncovered this plot and are now trying to capture Simon. Our latest intel shows us that he built a mech-suit that can only be destroyed using various sounds.

>Your job, Nomis, is to deprogram the mech-suit by working the sequence in reverse.

>Good luck.
