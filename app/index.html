<p id="storyText" style="display: none;">Near the end of the cold war, the Russians commissioned an engineer, code-named Simon, to make a brain-washing device in the form of a toy.
  The engineer was successful and deployed his device to millions of children the world over. 
  We've recently uncovered this plot and are now trying to capture Simon. Our latest intel shows us that he built a mech-suit that can only be destroyed using various sounds.
 <br /><br />
Your job, Nomis, is to deprogram the mech-suit by working the sequence in reverse.
 <br /><br />
Good luck.</p>
